ZETA ENGINE TODO LIST

- Add a font queue (like the translucent queue) to avoid flushing the renderer every single font change
- Batch some translucent sprites: (will do if becomes a problem)
	* everything with non-intersecting AABBs can be batched
- Add in some useful unit tests! The project can't just sit there for nothing.
- Add a Level/Entity system
	* the level should be an overridable class for each level
	* entities should be event-based
		- four initialisation funtions (ctor, pre-init, init, post-init)
		- step function called at 60Hz
		- render function called as often as possible
	* a struct containing useful globallly-accessible data to be passed around in all or most of these events
	* entities create their own renderables
	* renderer is passed around the events
- Use Tiled editor (or similar) to create an interface for making levels
- Particle engine
- Primitive rendering
- Cameras
- Make a forget() method on sounds that sends a pointer to the SoundManager which will automatically
  destroy it when it is done playing so it does not need to be manually managed
