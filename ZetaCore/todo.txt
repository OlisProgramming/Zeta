ZETA ENGINE TODO LIST

- Add a font queue (like the translucent queue) to avoid flushing the renderer every single font change
- Batch some translucent sprites: (will do if becomes a problem)
	* everything with non-intersecting AABBs can be batched
- Add in some useful unit tests! The project can't just sit there for nothing.
- Particle engine (attractors, deflectors, physics, automatic creation of new particles, automatic deletion of dead particles etc)
- Primitive rendering
- Implement level time and level frames in GlobalData / main function
- Implement useful builtin behaviours e.g. collision
- Functions in Level to:
	* test for (AABB?) collisions (possibly separate this into a physics namespace)
- Create a Game class to:
	* switch level
	* save/load game data
- Export Zeta as a .lib file (for Windows) so people can link it normally rather than having to compile source etc

POSSIBLE FUTURE ADD-ONS

- A 'path' system by using a Tiled polyline on an object layer, where entities can move along a path
- Stereo sound
