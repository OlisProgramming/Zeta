ZETA ENGINE TODO LIST

- Particle engine (attractors, deflectors, physics, automatic creation of new particles, automatic deletion of dead particles etc)
- Create a class to save/load game data
- Export Zeta as a .lib file (for Windows) so people can link it normally rather than having to compile source etc
- Frustum culling

POSSIBLE FUTURE ADD-ONS

- A 'path' system by using a Tiled polyline on an object layer, where entities can move along a path
- Stereo sound
- Lighting
